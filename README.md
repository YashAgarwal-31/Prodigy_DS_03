# Prodigy InfoTech Internship: Predictive Modeling with Decision Trees

Welcome to the third task of my Prodigy InfoTech Internship journey. This repository highlights my work on developing machine learning models, with a particular focus on data preparation, classification techniques, and generating meaningful business insights.

## Task Summary

In this task, I implemented a decision tree classification model to forecast whether a customer would engage with a product or service, utilizing their demographic and behavioral attributes. The analysis was conducted using a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Key Learnings

This project deepened my understanding of supervised learning techniques, particularly in constructing and evaluating decision tree models. I also gained valuable insights into how customer data can be used to predict purchasing behavior and guide strategic decision-making.
